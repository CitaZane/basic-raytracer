The main steps of ray-tracing process
1)  calculate the ray from the camera to the pixel
2) determine which objects the ray intersects
3)  compute a color for that intersection point.

TODO
1) Fix cube
2) test with plane
3) Create cylinder
4) implement input parsing

NOTES
 light intensity from 0.0 - 1.0
